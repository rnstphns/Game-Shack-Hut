# Game-Shack-Hut
Project for Software Engineering course at MIU

Project Description:

The Game Shack Hut, a local tabletop gaming store has contacted you with building some custom software for their employees and customers to use. 
For those unaware of the hobby, the place is something like this: https://www.thewyvernstaleavl.com/

Here is their list of requirements:

Inventory and calendar events should be hosted in-house.
Staff should be able to check out customer purchases with a (simulated) barcode scanner, search inventory, and interface with calendar events.
Managers should be able to perform Staff tasks, and update inventory database.
Customers should be able to access an event calendar and sign up for paid game sessions hosted weekly.

(I'm imagining an application that would be pulled up at a shop on a tablet at a shop register, and a fork with a simpler customer interface or
an entirely web-based customer interface).
